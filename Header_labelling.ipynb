The total number of outcomes for rolling two dice is 6 * 6 = 36 because each die has 6 faces, and we're looking at combinations, not permutations. We calculate the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total possible outcomes.\\n\\nThe successful outcome in this case is having a sum of 2, which happens in only one way: (1, 1).
